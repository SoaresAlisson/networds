## Anaphora Resolution:
https://github.com/EmoryNLP-Franzosi/automatic-svo-extraction

    Replace mentions of entities (e.g. pronouns like "he" and "she") with their most representative representations using Stanford CoreNLP's coreference (anaphora) resolution
    Used to maximize and validate SVO extraction by correctly identifying actors

For example:

> Bill Cato Attempted to Assault Mrs. Vickers. He was shot to death. 
will look like 
>  Bill Cato Attempted to Assault Mrs. Vickers. Bill Cato was shot to death. 
after anaphora resolution.
