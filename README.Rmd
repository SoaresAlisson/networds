# Extracting relations in text

This is a package to extract graphs and build  and visualize text networks in static and dynamic graphs.

It extract graphs from plain text using:

1) Rule based: Regex to extract proper names, and build a co-occurrence network
2) (under deveolpment) Extraction using Part of Speech tagging of proper names and nouns and its coocurrence
- extraction of relations (verbs, in most cases) like in {rsyntax} and {semgram}
3) (under development) Maybe a extraction using Local Large Language Models with {rollama}.
