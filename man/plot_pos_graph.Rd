\usage{
plot_pos_graph(
  pos_list,
  n_head = 30,
  edge_color = "lightblue",
  edge_alpha = 0.1,
  edge_norm = TRUE,
  font_size = 2,
  font_color = "black",
  point_fill = "firebrick4",
  point_alpha = 0.3,
  point_color = "firebrick4",
  graph_layout = "graphopt"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pos_list}{a list of POS, as returned by `get_cooc_entities()`}

\item{n_head}{maximum number of edges to show. The freq column must be ordered.
Default 30, but values near 150 maybe can be a better fit.}

\item{edge_color}{color of the edges}

\item{edge_alpha}{transparency of the edges. Values between 0 and 1.}

\item{edge_norm}{edge normalization if TRUE (default), normalize the result,
turning column into values between 0 and 10.}

\item{font_size}{integer. font size of the nodes. Values between 1 and 2.}

\item{font_color}{color of the nodes.}

\item{point_fill}{color of the nodes}

\item{point_alpha}{transparency of the nodes}

\item{point_color}{color of the nodes}

\item{graph_layout}{layout of the graph}
}
\description{
plot a graph of co-occurrence of terms, as returned by `get_cooc_entities()`.
The function uses ggraph, so some color options can not work as expected due
to some package incompatibilities.
The plot_pos_graph is based in ggraph, that is based on ggplot2. That means that
is possible to customize the graph with ggplot2 functions, like `labs()`.
