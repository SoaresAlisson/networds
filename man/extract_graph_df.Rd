\title{Extract a non directional graph based on co-occurrence in the token and returns a tibble
It extracts only if two entities are mentioned in the same token (sentence or paragraph)}
\usage{
extract_graph_df(
  df,
  column_id,
  column_text,
  using = "sentences",
  connect = connectors("misc"),
  sw = c("of", "the"),
  loop = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data frame with two columns: text and id}

\item{column_id}{name of the column with the id}

\item{column_text}{name the column with the text to extract the graph}

\item{using}{sentence or paragraph to tokenize}

\item{connect}{lowercase connectors, like the "von" in "John von Neumann".}

\item{sw}{stopwords vector.}

\item{loop}{if TRUE, it will not remove loops, a node pointing to itself.}
